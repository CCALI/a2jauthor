CAJA
====

This the private repo for the browser-based versions of A2J Author and Viewer.

## To setup:

### wkhtmltopdf

Before installing the server side depencencies, you need to install `wkhtmltopdf`
on your system, `wkhtmltopdf` is a command line tool that renders HTML into PDF.  The
easiest way to do this is to [download](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html#stable) a
prebuilt version for your system

Once `wkhtmltopdf` command line tool is available on your system, install the
node dependencies from the from the root folder of the app by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Then you need to install the dependencies of the CanJS Author and Viewer apps
which are located in  the `js` folder inside the root:

```
$ cd js
$ npm install
```


## To build the server code:

From the root folder (`CAJA/`) run
```
$ npm run build
```
This will also be done automatically when starting the server (see below).


## To run server tests:

From the root folder (`CAJA/`) run
```
$ npm test
```


## To run server locally:

From the root folder (`CAJA/`) run

```
$ npm start
```

Then, if you want to load the author app go to
[http://localhost:3000/js/author](http://localhost:3000/js/author) or go to
[http://localhost:3000/js/viewer](http://localhost:3000/js/viewer) if you want
to load the viewer app instead.

### Development mode:

By default, the server will run in production mode. This means that when accessing
the templates API, the server will try to validate the current user using their
PHP session information. To disable this, use the command:
```
$ npm run dev
```

This will start the server with NODE_ENV=development, which will default to the
username "dev" and assume the following folder structure:
```
CAJA/
userfiles/
  dev/
    guides/
```

### Server Configuration

In production mode, the server uses a configuration file called `config.json`
that is expected to be in the parent directory of the folder where the git repo
is cloned. This file should have the following structure:
```
{
  "SERVER_URL": "http://bitovi.a2jauthor.org/",
  "GUIDES_DIR": "f:/www/caja.cali.org/caja/userfiles/",
  "GUIDES_URL": "/caja/userfiles/",
  "SQL_HOST": "localhost",
  "SQL_USERNAME": "z",
  "SQL_PASSWD": "z",
  "SQL_DBNAME": "caja",
  "SQL_PORT": 3356,
  "DRUPAL_HOST": "localhost",
  "DRUPAL_USERNAME": "z",
  "DRUPAL_PASSWD": "z",
  "DRUPAL_DBNAME": "D7commons",
  "DRUPAL_PORT": 3356
}
```
The SERVER_URL and GUIDES_DIR properties are used by the Node server, but
this file will also be used by CONFIG.PHP, which also uses the database
connection information.

### Debugging the server:

Prepend any of the `npm` commands above with `DEBUG=A2J:*`
For example, to debug the server running locally:
```
$ DEBUG=A2J:* npm start
```
Then any `debug(...)` messages in the code will be displayed in the console.


## To build the Author and Viewer client code:

You need to install `grunt` first, follow the instructions in this [link](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli),
once the `grunt` CLI is available, run the following commands:

```
$ cd js
$ grunt build
```

If you want to view the app in production mode, just start the server (`npm start`)
and go to [http://localhost:3000/js/author/index.production.html](http://localhost:3000/js/author/index.production.html)
or [http://localhost:3000/js/viewer/index.production.html](http://localhost:3000/js/viewer/index.production.html)


### Keep in mind when setting a production environment:

You need to make sure `author/index.production.html` and `viewer/index.production.html` are loaded instead of `author/index.html` and `viewer/index.html` because the latter will load the development files one by one even if you follow the instructions to build the app.

The simplest way to accomplish this is to rename `author/index.html` to something like `author/index.dev.html` and then rename `author/index.production.html` to `author/index.html` (same thing should be done to the viewer index file).


## To run client tests:

```
$ npm test
```

or, if your local server is running (you ran `npm start` before) you can run tests in your browser
by loading [http://localhost:3000/js/author/test/](http://localhost:3000/js/author/test/) or
[http://localhost:3000/js/viewer/test/](http://localhost:3000/js/viewer/test/)


## To generate the documentation:

```
$ cd js
$ grunt documentjs
```

If you want to view the generated docs in your brower just do:

```
$ cd author/docs
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You should see something like the following:

`Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...`

Open up a brower and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
you should see the docs page!
