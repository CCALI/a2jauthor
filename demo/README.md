A2J VIEWER
==========

This the distributable production version of the A2J5 Viewer, below you will find
a tree representation of the files in this folder and what those files are:

```
├── data
│   ├── Guide.json
│   └── Guide.xml
├── dist
│   ├── ...
├── styles
│   └── viewer-avatars.css
└── viewer
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── ...
│   └── index.html
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

* The `data` folder is where the interview assets are located, here you'd put 
the Guide JSON and XML files, as well as other assets that the interview might 
need, like images, audio files, and template JSON files if the interview is using 
the Assemble destination buttons (Note: by default, this folder will contain a
`Guide.json` and `Guide.xml` files of an example interview create to showcase some
of the features of the viewer app).

* The `dist` folder is where the minified source files are located, these files
are generated by an automated build process and should not be modified, otherwise
the app might not work properly.

* The `styles` folder contains CSS required by the SVG file that renders the 
interview avatars.

* The `viewer` folder contains an `images` folder, which are images required to 
display the viewer correctly (e.g: courthouse background, avatars) and this folder
also contains the entry `index.html` which besides loading the app scripts also 
allows you to adjust some settings to modify the viewer app behaviour.

* The `package.json` file lists all of the development dependecies of the viewer 
app, and should not be modified.


## To run the app:

You just need to place the containing folder so that your server can reach it 
and then you should be able to load the app by loading in your browser 
`{url to a2j-viewer folder}/viewer` which will load the `index.html` file inside
the `viewer` folder.
