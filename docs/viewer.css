* Each CSS component has less variables that define basic values for styling that component. Each variable can be re-used anywhere in the component or app. For example, common colors, grid sizes, and margin / padding are all defined using variables.
*
* The default Bootstrap `variables.less` file has been broken up into multiple files. Each CSS component file now contains it's own variables. This file `@import`s all the other variable files.

* All HTML headings, `<h1>` through `<h6>`, are available. `.h1` through `.h6` classes are also available,
* for when you want to match the font styling of a heading but still want your text to be displayed inline.
*
* H tags defining a typographical heirarchy. Each page of the application should use the appropriate header level based on semantics, rather than font size. For example, an `<h2>` should not be used if there is not a parent `<h1>` - if the font sizes are not appropriate for the context, these can be adjusted on an individual-level in component specific style sheets. However, the defined header level sizes should usually be honored.

/**
  * @stylesheet buttons.less Buttons
  * @parent styles-base 1
  *
  * @description
  * Use the button classes on an `<a>`, `<button>`, or `<input>` element.
  *
  * ```
  * <a class="btn btn-default" href="#" role="button">Link</a>
  * <button class="btn btn-default" type="submit">Button</button>
  * <input class="btn btn-default" type="button" value="Input">
  * <input class="btn btn-default" type="submit" value="Submit">
  *```
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons/demo.html
  *
  * > #### Context-specific usage
  * > While button classes can be used on `<a>` and `<button>` elements, only `<button>` elements are supported within our nav and navbar components.
  *
  * > #### Links acting as buttons
  * > If the `<a>` elements are used to act as buttons - triggering in-page functionality, rather than navigating to another document or section within the current page - they should also be given an appropriate `role="button"`.
  *
  * > #### Cross-browser rendering
  * > As a best practice, we highly recommend using the `<button>` element whenever possible to ensure matching cross-browser rendering.
  * >
  * > Among other things, there's a bug in Firefox <30 that prevents us from setting the `line-height` of `<input>` - based buttons, causing them to not exactly match the height of other buttons on Firefox.
  *
  * ## Options
  * Use any of the available button classes to quickly create a styled button.
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons-options/demo.html
  *
  * > #### Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
  * > Using color to add meaning to a button only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies - such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (the visible text of the button), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the `.sr-only` class.
  *
  * ## Dropdown
  * Any button can be a dropdown toggle.
  * 
  * The interaction is handled by `dropdown.js` which is not included in the style guide. 
  * The javascript adds a class `.open` to the parent `.btn-group` class allowing the 
  * `.dropdown-menu` class to display.
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons-dropdown/demo.html
  *
  * ## Sizes
  * Fancy larger or smaller buttons- Add `.btn-lg`, `.btn-sm`, or `.btn-xs` for additional sizes.
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons-sizes/demo.html
  *
  * Create block level buttons-those that span the full width of a parent- by adding `.btn-block`.
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons-block/demo.html
  *
  * ## Active state
  * Buttons will appear pressed (with a darker background, darker border, and inset shadow) when active. For `<button>` elements, this is done via `:active`. For `<a>` elements, it's done with `.active`. However, you may use `.active` on `<button>`s (and include the `aria-pressed="true"` attribute) should you need to replicate the active state programmatically.
  *
  * ### Button element
  * No need to add `:active` as it's a pseudo-class, but if you need to force the same appearance, go ahead and add `.active`.
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons-element/demo.html
  *
  * ### Anchor element
  * Add the `.active` class to `<a>` buttons.
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons-anchor/demo.html
  *
  * ## Disabled state
  * Make buttons look unclickable by fading them back with `opacity`.
  *
  * ### Button element
  * Add the `disabled` attribute to `<button>` buttons.
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons-disabled-element/demo.html
  *
  * > #### Cross-browser compatibility
  * > If you add the `disabled` attribute to a `<button>`, Internet Explorer 9 and below will render text gray with a nasty text-shadow that we cannot fix.
  *
  * ### Anchor element
  * Add the `.disabled` class to `<a>` buttons.
  *
  * @demo demos/buttons-disabled-anchor/demo.html
  *
  * We use .disabled as a utility class here, similar to the common .active class, so no prefix is required.
  *
  * > #### Link functionality caveat
  * > This class uses `pointer-events: none` to try to disable the link functionality of `<a>`s, but that CSS property is not yet standardized and isn't fully supported in Opera 18 and below, or in Internet Explorer 11. In addition, even in browsers that do support `pointer-events: none`, keyboard navigation remains unaffected, meaning that sighted keyboard users and users of assistive technologies will still be able to activate these links. So to be safe, use custom JavaScript to disable such links.

  **/
/**
  * @styles default-navbar
  * @parent navbar.less 1
  * ## Default Navbar
  * **Justified navbar nav links are currently not supported.**
  *
  * #### Overflowing content
  * Since Bootstrap doesn't know how much space the content in your navbar needs,
  * you might run into issues with content wrapping into a second row.
  * To resolve this, you can:
  * * Reduce the amount or width of navbar items.
  * * Hide certain navbar items at certain screen sizes using responsive utility classes.
  * * Change the point at which your navbar switches between collapsed and horizontal mode. Customize the `@grid-float-breakpoint` variable or add your own media query.
  *
  * #### Requires JavaScript plugin
  * If JavaScript is disabled and the viewport is narrow enough that the navbar
  * collapses, it will be impossible to expand the navbar and view the content
  * within the `.navbar-collapse`.
  *
  * The responsive navbar requires the collapse plugin to be included in your
  * version of Bootstrap.
  *
  * #### Changing the collapsed mobile navbar breakpoint
  * The navbar collapses into its vertical mobile view when the viewport is
  * narrower than `@grid-float-breakpoint`, and expands into its horizontal
  * non-mobile view when the viewport is at least `@grid-float-breakpoint` in width.
  * Adjust this variable in the Less source to control when the navbar collapses/expands.
  * The default value is 768px (the smallest "small" or "tablet" screen).
  *
  * #### Make navbars accessible
  * Be sure to use a `<nav>` element or, if using a more generic element such
  * as a `<div>`, add a `role="navigation"` to every navbar to explicitly identify
  * it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies.

  *
  * As a heads up, .navbar-form shares much of its code with `.form-inline` via
  * mixin. Some form controls, like input groups, may require fixed widths to
  * be show up properly within a navbar.
  *
  * #### Mobile device caveats
  * There are some caveats regarding using form controls within fixed elements
  * on mobile devices. See our browser support docs for details.
  * #### Always add labels
  * Screen readers will have trouble with your forms if you don't include a label
  * for every input. For these inline forms, you can hide the labels using the
  * `.sr-only class`. There are further alternative methods of providing a label
  * for assistive technologies, such as the `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or
  * `title` attribute. If none of these is present, screen readers may resort to
  * using the `placeholder` attribute, if present, but note that use of

  *
  * These classes are mixin-ed versions of `.pull-left` and `.pull-right`, but
  * they're scoped to media queries for easier handling of navbar components
  * across device sizes.
  * #### Right aligning multiple components
  * Navbars currently have a limitation with multiple `.navbar-right classes`.
  * To properly space content, we use negative margin on the last `.navbar-right`
  * element. When there are multiple elements using that class, these margins
  * don't work as intended.
  *
  * We'll revisit this when we can rewrite that component in v4.

/**
  * @stylesheet forms.less Forms
  * @parent styles-base 5
  *
  * Use of the `<forms>` element
  *
  * ## Basic example
  * Individual form controls automatically receive some global styling. All textual `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` elements with `.form-control` are set to `width: 100%;` by default. Wrap labels and controls in `.form-group` for optimum spacing.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms/demo.html
  *
  * > #### Don't mix form groups with input groups
  * > Do not mix form groups directly with input groups. Instead, nest the input group inside of the form group.
  *
  * ## Inline form
  * Add `.form-inline` to your form (which doesn't have to be a `<form>`) for left-aligned and inline-block controls. **This only applies to forms within viewports that are at least 768px wide.**
  *
  * > #### May require custom widths
  * > Inputs and selects have `width: 100%;` applied by default in Bootstrap. Within inline forms, we reset that to `width: auto;` so multiple controls can reside on the same line. Depending on your layout, additional custom widths may be required.
  *
  * > #### Always add labels
  * > Screen readers will have trouble with your forms if you don't include a label for every input. For these inline forms, you can hide the labels using the `.sr-only` class. There are further alternative methods of providing a label for assistive technologies, such as the `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `title` attribute. If none of these is present, screen readers may resort to using the `placeholder` attribute, if present, but note that use of `placeholder` as a replacement for other labelling methods is not advised.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-inline/demo1.html
  * @demo demos/forms-inline/demo2.html
  * @demo demos/forms-inline/demo3.html
  *
  * ## Horizontal form
  * Use Bootstrap's predefined grid classes to align labels and groups of form controls in a horizontal layout by adding `.form-horizontal` to the form (which doesn't have to be a `<form>`). Doing so changes `.form-groups` to behave as grid rows, so no need for `.row`.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-horizontal/demo.html
  *
  * ## Supported controls
  * Examples of standard form controls supported in an example form layout.
  *
  * ### Inputs
  * Most common form control, text-based input fields. Includes support for all HTML5 types: `text`, `password`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`, `number`, `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`, and `color`.
  *
  * > #### Type declaration required
  * > Inputs will only be fully styled if their `type` is properly declared.
  *
  * **Example:**
  *
  * ```
  * <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Text input">
  * ```
  *
  * **Results in:**
  * @iframe demos/forms-inputs/demo.html
  *
  *
  * > #### Input groups
  * > To add integrated text or buttons before and/or after any text-based `<input>`, check out the input group component.
  *
  *
  * ### Textarea
  * Form control which supports multiple lines of text. Change `rows` attribute as necessary.
  *
  * **Example:**
  *
  * ```
  * <textarea class="form-control" rows="3"></textarea>
  * ```
  * **Results in:**
  * @iframe demos/forms-textarea/demo.html
  *
  *
  * ### Checkboxes and radios
  * Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting one option from many.
  *
  * A checkbox or radio with the `disabled` attribute will be styled appropriately. To have the `<label>` for the checkbox or radio also display a "not-allowed" cursor when the user hovers over the label, add the `.disabled` class to your `.radio`, `.radio-inline`, `.checkbox`, `.checkbox-inline`, or `<fieldset>`.
  *
  * #### Default (stacked)
  * @demo demos/forms-checkboxes-radios/demo.html
  *
  * #### Inline checkboxes and radios
  * Use the `.checkbox-inline` or `.radio-inline` classes on a series of checkboxes or radios for controls that appear on the same line.
  * @demo demos/forms-checkboxes-radios/inline.html
  *
  * #### Checkboxes and radios without label text
  * Should you have no text within the `<label>`, the input is positioned as you'd expect. **Currently only works on non-inline checkboxes and radios.** Remember to still provide some form of label for assistive technologies (for instance, using `aria-label`).
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-checkboxes-radios/without-label.html
  *
  * ### Selects
  * Note that many native select menus-namely in Safari and Chrome-have rounded corners that cannot be modified via `border-radius` properties.
  *
  * **Example:**
  *
  * ```
  * <select class="form-control">
  *  <option>1</option>
  *  <option>2</option>
  *  <option>3</option>
  *  <option>4</option>
  *  <option>5</option>
  * </select>
  * ```
  * **Results in:**
  * @iframe demos/forms-selects/demo1.html
  *
  *
  *
  * For `<select>` controls with the `multiple attribute`, multiple options are shown by default.
  *
  * **Example:**
  *
  * ```
  * <select multiple class="form-control">
  *  <option>1</option>
  *  <option>2</option>
  *  <option>3</option>
  *  <option>4</option>
  *  <option>5</option>
  * </select>
  * ```
  * **Results in:**
  * @iframe demos/forms-selects/demo2.html
  *
  *
  * ## Static control
  * When you need to place plain text next to a form label within a form, use the `.form-control-static class` on a `<p>`.
  *
  * #### Example
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-static/demo1.html
  *
  * #### Example
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-static/demo2.html
  *
  *
  * ## Focus state
  * We remove the default `outline` styles on some form controls and apply a `box-shadow` in its place for `:focus`.
  *
  * ## Disabled state
  * Add the `disabled` boolean attribute on an input to prevent user interactions. Disabled inputs appear lighter and add a `not-allowed` cursor.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-disabled/demo.html
  *
  * ### Disabled fieldsets
  * Add the `disabled` attribute to a `<fieldset>` to disable all the controls within the `<fieldset>` at once.
  *
  * > #### Caveat about link functionality of `<a>`
  * > By default, browsers will treat all native form controls (`<input>`, `<select>` and `<button>` elements) inside a `<fieldset disabled>` as disabled, preventing both keyboard and mouse interactions on them. However, if your form also includes `<a ... class="btn btn-*">` elements, these will only be given a style of `pointer-events: none`. As noted in the section about disabled state for buttons (and specifically in the sub-section for anchor elements), this CSS property is not yet standardized and isn't fully supported in Opera 18 and below, or in Internet Explorer 11, and won't prevent keyboard users from being able to focus or activate these links. So to be safe, use custom JavaScript to disable such links.
  *
  * > #### Cross-browser compatibility
  * > While Bootstrap will apply these styles in all browsers, Internet Explorer 11 and below don't fully support the `disabled` attribute on a `<fieldset>`. Use custom JavaScript to disable the fieldset in these browsers.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-disabled/fieldsets.html
  *
  * ## Readonly state
  * Add the `readonly` boolean attribute on an input to prevent modification of the input's value. Read-only inputs appear lighter (just like disabled inputs), but retain the standard cursor.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-readonly/demo.html
  *
  * ## Validation states
  * Bootstrap includes validation styles for error, warning, and success states on form controls. To use, add `.has-warning`, `.has-error`, or `.has-success` to the parent element. Any `.control-label`, `.form-control`, and `.help-block` within that element will receive the validation styles.
  *
  * > #### Conveying validation state to assistive technologies and colorblind users
  * > Using these validation styles to denote the state of a form control only provides a visual, color-based indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies - such as screen readers - or to colorblind users.
  * >
  * > Ensure that an alternative indication of state is also provided. For instance, you can include a hint about state in the form control's `<label>` text itself (as is the case in the following code example), include a Glyphicon (with appropriate alternative text using the `.sr-only` class - see the Glyphicon examples), or by providing an additional help text block. Specifically for assistive technologies, invalid form controls can also be assigned an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-validation/demo.html
  *
  * ### Use with `.has-error`, `.has-warning`, `.has-success`, and `.codeedit`
  * Adds notification background colors to inputs with `.codeedit` inputs. Colors defined in `alerts.less` file.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-validation/codeedit.html
  *
  * ### With optional icons
  * You can also add optional feedback icons with the addition of .has-feedback and the right icon. **Feedback icons only work with textual `<input class="form-control">` elements.**
  *
  * > #### Icons, labels, and input groups
  * > Manual positioning of feedback icons is required for inputs without a label and for input groups with an add-on on the right. You are strongly encouraged to provide labels for all inputs for accessibility reasons. If you wish to prevent labels from being displayed, hide them with the `.sr-only` class. If you must do without labels, adjust the `top` value of the feedback icon. For input groups, adjust the `right` value to an appropriate pixel value depending on the width of your addon.
  *
  * > #### Conveying the icon's meaning to assistive technologies
  * > To ensure that assistive technologies - such as screen readers - correctly convey the meaning of an icon, additional hidden text should be included with the `.sr-only` class and explicitly associated with the form control it relates to using `aria-describedby`. Alternatively, ensure that the meaning (for instance, the fact that there is a warning for a particular text entry field) is conveyed in some other form, such as changing the text of the actual `<label>` associated with the form control.
  * >
  * > Although the following examples already mention the validation state of their respective form controls in the `<label>` text itself, the above technique (using `.sr-only` text and `aria-describedby`) has been included for illustrative purposes.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-validation/icons.html
  *
  * ### Optional icons in horizontal and inline forms
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-validation/icons-horizontal.html
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-validation/icons-inline.html
  *
  * ### Optional icons with hidden `.sr-only` labels
  * If you use the `.sr-only` class to hide a form control's `<label>` (rather than using other labelling options, such as the `aria-label` attribute), Bootstrap will automatically adjust the position of the icon once it's been added.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-validation/icons-hidden.html
  *
  * ## Control sizing
  * Set heights using classes like `.input-lg`, and set widths using grid column classes like `.col-lg-*`.
  *
  * ### Height sizing
  * Create taller or shorter form controls that match button sizes.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-sizing/demo.html
  *
  * ### Horizontal form group sizes
  * Quickly size labels and form controls within `.form-horizontal` by adding `.form-group-lg` or `.form-group-sm`.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-sizing/horizontal.html
  *
  * ### Column sizing
  * Wrap inputs in grid columns, or any custom parent element, to easily enforce desired widths.
  *
  * @demo demos/forms-sizing/column.html
  *
  * ## Help text
  * Block level help text for form controls.
  *
  * > #### Associating help text with form controls
  * > Help text should be explicitly associated with the form control it relates to using the `aria-describedby` attribute. This will ensure that assistive technologies - such as screen readers - will announce this help text when the user focuses or enters the control.

/**
  * @stylesheet navs.less Navs
  * @parent styles-base 9
  *
  * @description
  * Navs available in Bootstrap have shared markup, starting with the base `.nav`
  * class, as well as shared states. Swap modifier classes to switch between
  * each style.
  *
  * #### Using navs for tab panels requires JavaScript tabs plugin
  * For tabs with tabbable areas, you must use the tabs JavaScript plugin.
  * The markup will also require additional role and ARIA attributes – see the
  * plugin's example markup for further details.
  *
  * #### Make navs used as navigation accessible
  * If you are using navs to provide a navigation bar, be sure to add a
  * `role="navigation"` to the most logical parent container of the `<ul>`, or
  * wrap a `<nav>` element around the whole navigation. Do not add the role to
  * the `<ul>` itself, as this would prevent it from being announced as an actual
  * list by assistive technologies.

  * Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.
  *
  * ## Examples
  * Wrap any text and an optional dismiss button in `.alert` and one of the four contextual classes (e.g., `.alert-success`) for basic alert messages.
  *
  * ````
  * <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">...</div>

  *
  * @demo demos/alerts/demo.html
  *
  * ## Dismissible alerts
  * Build on any alert by adding an optional `.alert-dismissible` and close button.
  *
  * @demo demos/dismissable-alerts/demo.html
  *
  * ### Ensure proper behavior across all devices
  * Be sure to use the `<button>` element with the `data-dismiss="alert"` data attribute.
  *
  * ## Links in alerts
  * Use the `.alert-link` utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert.

@stylesheet modals.less Modals
@parent styles-base 2

Modals are streamlined, but flexible, dialog prompts with the minimum required functionality and smart defaults.

> ### Multiple open modals not supported
> Be sure not to open a modal while another is still visible. Showing more than one modal at a time requires custom code.

> ### Modal markup placement
> Always try to place a modal's HTML code in a top-level position in your document to avoid other components affecting the > modal's appearance and/or functionality.

> ### Mobile device caveats
> There are some caveats regarding using modals on mobile devices. [See our browser support docs](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-fixed-position-keyboards) for details.


## Examples

### Static example
A rendered modal with header, body, and set of actions in the footer.

@demo demos/modals/demo.html


> ### Make modals accessible
> Be sure to add `role="dialog"` and `aria-labelledby="..."`, referencing the modal title, to `.modal`, and `role="document">` to the `.modal-dialog` itself.
>
> Additionally, you may give a description of your modal dialog with `aria-describedby` on `.modal`.

## Optional sizes
Modals have two optional sizes, available via modifier classes to be placed on a `modal-dialog`.

### Small `.modal-sm`
@demo demos/modals/optional-sizes/small.html

### Large `.modal-lg`
@demo demos/modals/optional-sizes/large.html


## Using the grid system
To take advantage of the Bootstrap grid system within a modal, just nest `.container-fluid` within the `.modal-body` and then use the normal grid system classes within this container.

@demo demos/modals/using-grid-system/demo.html

Although it looks like a triangle, it is actually a rectangle with a diagonal gradient that has hard color stops from top to bottom.
 *
 * <img class="img-responsive" src="demos/sidewalk/images/sidewalk.png" />
 *
 * Additionally, the sidewalk adds a pseudo element of `:after` to create right-side padding.
 *
 * Altogether, the sidewalk's important elements are the linear gradient created with:
 *
 * ```
 * background: linear-gradient(to right bottom, transparent 50%, @@sidewalk-color 50%);
 * ```
 *
 * And the `:after` pseudo element, which creates the padding:
 *
 * ```

 * @parent styles-viewer 2
 *
 * Bubbles are used to represent the words of the guide or the client throughout A2J interviews in the Viewer application.
 *
 * @demo demos/bubble/demo.html
 *
 * Bubbles can also be used on their own. The basic markup for a bubble is:
 *
 * ```
 * <div class="bubble top">
  <span class="bubble-arrow"></span>
    <div class="bubble-content">
      ...
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">Continue</button>
</div>

 * ```
 *
 * @demo demos/bubble/bubble-variation.html
 *
 * Any content inside `bubble-content` will be automatically scrolled depending on the height of the bubble and the viewport. Content outside this container will not be scrolled.
 *
 * ## Bubble Arrows
 *
 * The bubble's arrow is generated using CSS pseudo elements. It's a CSS triangle with a background color (white) and a border on two sides (gray).
 *
 * ```
 * <span class="bubble-arrow"></span>
 * ```
 *
 * While the bubble would normally be inside the `bubble` div container so that it's attached to the bubble, in the A2J Viewer application the bubble arrow is actually part of the Avatar image so that the arrow is pointed at the avatar's face.

/**
* @stylesheet avatars.less Avatars
* @parent styles-viewer 1
*
* Avatars are used to represent both the guide and the client throughout A2J interviews in the Viewer application.
*
* Avatars are added programmatically using javascript so that are displayed inline, rather than loaded in using 
* `<img>` or `<object>` tags. Being loaded in inline makes them easier to style, but was a necessity to support Edge
* and IE11, where we were experiencing an issue loading them as <object> tags (shrinking and adding scroll bars 
* to the <object> tag and then making the SVG disappear when clicked on).
* 
* The avatars were created in Adobe Illustrator (minimizing shapes and creating transparent paths for 
* shading/lightening), then optimized using SVGo (https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/), and classes 
* cleaned up, refined, and added using a code editor. This outputs smaller, cleaner SVGs. If you want to 
* see the SVGs, inspect the code below, or navigate to the images folder for this demo – 
* demos/avatars/images/

*
* The avatar skin tone is dynamically set by JavaScript based on a selection of the Author in the interview. 
* The JavaScript takes the data for the skin tone and applies it directly to the SVG file itself as a classname. 
* For example, the SVG file `avatar-male-left.svg` contains the following classname `skin-darker` by default. 
* Changing this classname to any of the above will alter the skin tone:
*
* Each file needs to have a classname set on the `<svg>` element of either `avatar-guide` or `avatar-client` 
* along with a gender, `avatar-male` or `avatar-female`, and default skin tone classname like `skin-darker`. 
* For example:
*
* ```
* <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="Guide-Male-Left" class="avatar-guide avatar-female skin-darker" 
* viewBox="0 0 250.5 757.6"> ... </svg>

/**
* @styles color-classes Additional Color Classes
* @parent avatars.less 4
*
* Each SVG file also has several elements which contain similar classes that determine what colors are applied
* to that portion of the vector image. For example, the avatar's skin tone will have `class="skin-color"` 
* which allows the CSS to apply the skin tone to that class. These classes can be edited directly in a code editor.
*
* Colors in SVGs are controlled by fills (e.g. `.shoe-color { fill: #5e7077`;}).
*
* Here is a list of currently used classes that apply color to the SVGs:
*
*  * Hair color `.hair-color`
*  * Skin tone `.skin-color`
*  * Shirt/Tie color`.shirt-color`
*  * Suit coat color (guides only) `.suit-color`
*  * Buttons on suit coats (female guide only) `.button-color`
*  * Pant color (for guides set suit-color and pant color to the same fill) `.pant-color`
*  * Shoe color `.shoe-color`
*
* ### Shades and Lighten Classes
*
* Each SVG file also has several internal (within the file) classes that determine what elements get 
* shaded/lightend are applied to that portion of the vector image. For example, the avatar's facial features 
* have `class="nose-shade"`, `class="eye-right-shade"`, and `class="eye-left-shade"` which allows the CSS 
* to darken and apply a gradient created within the SVG (referred to by and ID, e.g. `#afl-neck-shade_1_`). `avatar-female-XXX.svg` files have `class="hair-shade"` to highlight and darken portions of the hair. These 
* classes can be edited directly in a code editor. 
*
* Colors in SVGs are controlled by fills (e.g. `.hair-shade { fill: #5e7077`;}). If you want to overwrite 
* these classes, you will need to do so with an `!important` declaration in your stylesheet. If you do not 
* want the class to apply at all, for example, if you were making an avatar bald:
* ```
.hair-color {display: none;}
.hair-shade {display: none;}
```
*
*
* @iframe demos/avatars/hair.html 600
*
*
* Here is a list of currently used classes that apply shades/lighten to the SVGs:
*
*  * Hair shade and lighten `.hair-shade`
*  * Nose shade gradient `.nose-shade`
*  * Eye shade gradients `.eye-left-shade` and `.eye-right-shade`
*  * Under chin shade gradient `.neck-shade`
*  * Ear shade gradient `.ear-shade`
*
* Pants, suits, shirts, hands, and arms have gradients applied to paths overlayed as well, but since 
* these won't need to change there haven't been global classes created for them.
