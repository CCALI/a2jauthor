  *
  * Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.
  *
  * ## Examples
  * Wrap any text and an optional dismiss button in `.alert` and one of the four contextual classes (e.g., `.alert-success`) for basic alert messages.
  *
  * ````
  * <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">...</div>
  * ````
  *
  * ### No default class
  * Alerts don't have default classes, only base and modifier classes. A default gray alert doesn't make too much sense, so you're required to specify a type via contextual class. Choose from success, info, warning, or danger.

  *
  * ## Dismissible alerts
  * Build on any alert by adding an optional `.alert-dismissible` and close button.

  * @demo docs/demos/dismissable-alerts/demo.html
  *
  * ### Ensure proper behavior across all devices
  * Be sure to use the `<button>` element with the `data-dismiss="alert"` data attribute.
  *
  * ## Links in alerts
  * Use the `.alert-link` utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert.
