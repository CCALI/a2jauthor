Modals are streamlined, but flexible, dialog prompts with the minimum required functionality and smart defaults.

> ### Multiple open modals not supported
> Be sure not to open a modal while another is still visible. Showing more than one modal at a time requires custom code.

> ### Modal markup placement
> Always try to place a modal's HTML code in a top-level position in your document to avoid other components affecting the > modal's appearance and/or functionality.

> ### Mobile device caveats
> There are some caveats regarding using modals on mobile devices. [See our browser support docs](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-fixed-position-keyboards) for details.


## Examples

### Static example
A rendered modal with header, body, and set of actions in the footer.

@demo docs/demos/js-modals/demo.html


> ### Make modals accessible
> Be sure to add `role="dialog"` and `aria-labelledby="..."`, referencing the modal title, to `.modal`, and `role="document">` to the `.modal-dialog` itself.
>
> Additionally, you may give a description of your modal dialog with `aria-describedby` on `.modal`.

## Optional sizes
Modals have two optional sizes, available via modifier classes to be placed on a `modal-dialog`.

@demo docs/demos/js-modals/optional-sizes/demo.html


## Using the grid system
To take advantage of the Bootstrap grid system within a modal, just nest `.container-fluid` within the `.modal-body` and then use the normal grid system classes within this container.
