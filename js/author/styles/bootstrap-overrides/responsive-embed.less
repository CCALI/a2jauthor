  * Allow browsers to determine video or slideshow dimensions based on the width of their containing block by creating an intrinsic ratio that will properly scale on any device.
  *
  * Rules are directly applied to `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, `<video>`, and `<object>` elements; optionally use an explicit descendant class `.embed-responsive-item` when you want to match the styling for other attributes.
  *
  * **Pro-Tip!** You don't need to include `frameborder="0"` in your `<iframe>`s as we override that for you.
