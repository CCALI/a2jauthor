/**
  * @stylesheet button-groups.less Button Groups
  * @parent styles-base 2
  *
  * @description
  * Group a series of buttons together on a single line with the button group.
  * Add on optional JavaScript radio and checkbox style behavior with our buttons plugin.
  *
  * #### Tooltips & popovers in button groups require special setting
  * When using tooltips or popovers on elements within a `.btn-group`, you'll
  * have to specify the option container: 'body' to avoid unwanted side effects
  * (such as the element growing wider and/or losing its rounded corners when
  * the tooltip or popover is triggered).
  *
  * #### Ensure correct role and provide a label
  * In order for assistive technologies – such as screen readers – to convey
  * that a series of buttons is grouped, an appropriate role attribute needs to
  * be provided. For button groups, this would be `role="group"`, while toolbars
  * should have a `role="toolbar".
  *
  * One exception are groups which only contain a single control (for instance
  * the justified button groups with `<button>` elements) or a dropdown.
  *
  * In addition, groups and toolbars should be given an explicit label, as most
  * assistive technologies will otherwise not announce them, despite the presence
  * of the correct role attribute. In the examples provided here, we use aria-label,
  * but alternatives such as aria-labelled by can also be used.

  /**
  @styles button-groups-justified
    @parent button-groups.less 5
  * ## Justified button groups
  * Make a group of buttons stretch at equal sizes to span the entire width of
  * its parent. Also works with button dropdowns within the button group.
  *
  * ##### Handling borders
  * Due to the specific HTML and CSS used to justify buttons
  * (namely `display: table-cell`), the borders between them are doubled. In
  * regular button groups, `margin-left: -1px` is used to stack the borders instead
  * of removing them. However, margin doesn't work with `display: table-cell`.
  * As a result, depending on your customizations to Bootstrap, you may wish to
  * remove or re-color the borders.
  * ##### IE8 and borders
  * Internet Explorer 8 doesn't render borders on buttons in a justified button group,
  * whether it's on `<a>` or `<button>` elements. To get around that, wrap each
  * button in another `.btn-group`.
  *
  * ##### With `<a>` Elements
  * Just wrap a series of `.btns` in `.btn-group.btn-group-justified`.
  *
  * @demo docs/demos/button-groups/justified/demo.html
  *
  * ##### Links acting as buttons
  * If the `<a>` elements are used to act as buttons – triggering in-page
  * functionality, rather than navigating to another document or section within
  * the current page – they should also be given an appropriate `role="button"`.

  * #### With `<button>` Elements
  * To use justified button groups with `<button>` elements, you must wrap each
  * button in a button group. Most browsers don't properly apply our CSS for
  * justification to `<button>` elements, but since we support button dropdowns,
  * we can work around that.

  * ## Dropdown Menus within Buttons
  * Bootstrap has the ability to add dropdown menus within button groups. This is not currently part of the A2J app, but can be added with a little JavaScript and adding the reference `.less` file to `styles.less` within the app like `@import "@{bootstrap-base}/dropdowns.less";`
  *
  * Place a `.btn-group` within another `.btn-group` when you want dropdown menus
  * mixed with a series of buttons.
