The state in which you sit follows the Federal Rules of Evidence.</P><P>The lesson will give trial testimony in question and answer form. It will note when an objection has been made and ask you to rule on it. Because it will sometimes be necessary to know what answer is expected in order to rule on an objection, the lesson will tell you both the attorney's question and the answer that the witness would give if permitted.</P><P>The case on which you are sitting is a civil action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained when an automobile driven by Plaintiff was involved in an intersection collision with an automobile driven by Defendant. At a pre-trial conference, you learned that Plaintiff will seek to prove that Defendant ran a red light, drove at an excessive speed, and failed to keep a proper lookout. Defendant will deny the acts of negligence imputed to him and claim that Plaintiff was negligent in ignoring a police officer's warning not to enter the intersection in which the collision occurred.</P></TEXT> <MAPPER ID="2" BOUNDS="544,111,109">  <BRANCH KIND="11" NAME="Next" DEST="5" BOUNDS="584,159,30"/> </MAPPER></PAGE>

He did not concede fault. However, the word &quot;admission&quot; in the phrase &quot;admission of a party-opponent&quot; is a legal term of art. An &quot;admission&quot; does not have to be against interest, self-inculpatory, or self-degrading. ANY statement by a party that is offered at trial by the opposing party is the admission of a party-opponent, and it clears the hearsay hurdle whether or not it was against interest when made.</P><P>Of course, an admission may be inadmissible for other reasons, such as irrelevance, but the hearsay rule poses no obstacle. (Here, relevance is not a problem either because the jury could infer from the statement that Defendant went through the red light and was trying to make an excuse for this mistake.)

Plaintiff's lawyer might argue that the evidence is immaterial because Plaintiff's intoxication was not one of the issues defined in the pre-trial conference. However, Defendant's lawyer could make a convincing argument that the evidence of drunkenness is admissible for impeachment purposes--that is, to show that Plaintiff was not in condition to observe the accident carefully and that therefore his testimony is not credible.

I disagree. The rationale of the business records rule is that records are likely to be accurate if they are kept with regularity as part of the routine of the business. Here, there has been no showing of regularity. Moreover, the statement was oral, not written, and there is some authority for the proposition that oral statements are not covered by the business records exception. See McCormick on Evidence &#167;&#160;307. In fact, I question whether this statement even falls within the concept of &quot;record,&quot; because there is no indication that the handyman was making the statement with the intent that it be recorded as part of the functioning of his business. </P></ANSWER> <ANSWER GRADE="WRONG" NEXTPAGE="Question 14-Overrule-Admission" MATCHSTYLE="MatchExact" COMMENT="admission" MATCHES="admission{TAB}801(d)(2)"></ANSWER> <ANSWER GRADE="WRONG" MATCHSTYLE="MatchExact" COMMENT="presentssense" MATCHES="&quot;present sense&quot;{TAB}impression or 803(1)"><P>Not the best answer.

This testimony meets both criteria. The eyewitness saw the vehicle, so the testimony, assuming he has ordinary experience in assessing speed, is certainly rationally based upon his perception. Assuming that speed is relevant to the action, the witness' estimate of it in terms of miles per hour will be helpful to the fact finder.

The handyman is not a party to the lawsuit and therefore nothing he says can be an admission of a party. An argument could, however, be made that Defendant's non-response was an admission by silence. However, even this argument is not very strong. Identify an entirely new reason, other than the admissions theory, why this statement is not barred by the hearsay rule. </P></FEEDBACK> <FEEDBACK BUTTON="2" DETAIL="1" GRADE="RIGHT"><P>Your answer is ingenious, but in my opinion there are better grounds for overruling the objection.</P><P>Since the handyman is not a party to the lawsuit, his statement is not automatically admissible as the admission of a party-opponent. Admittedly, the handyman's statement might become admissible on an admission-of-a-party theory if Defendant endorsed the statement in his response to it. However, on the facts stated, you do not know what response Defendant made to the handyman's statement.</P><P>The handyman's statement indicated that the brakes were in need of repair. If Defendant responded by acknowledging that the brakes needed repair (e.g., by saying, &quot;They're in terrible shape--maybe I ought to leave the car here&quot;) then both his statement and the handyman's statement would be admissible as admissions of Defendant. If Defendant responded to the handyman's statement by remaining silent or by changing the subject, a reasonable argument could be made that in doing so he implicitly adopted the statement--on the theory that if the handyman's statement had been untrue, Defendant would have responded by denying that the brakes were bad. See McCormick on Evidence &#167;&#160;269. However, if Defendant responded by saying that nothing was wrong with the brakes, then he could not be deemed to have endorsed the handyman's statement, and the handyman's statement could not be admitted as an admission of Defendant.</P><P>Although there is something to be said for the possibility that Defendant's response might have constituted an admission, there is a stronger reason on the facts of this problem for ruling that the testimony is barred by the hearsay rule.

In contrast, when the opinion is contained in an out-of-court statement, the declarant's observation must either be admitted in opinion form or excluded altogether, it cannot be made more specific. It should be admitted if it will be helpful to the trier of fact. Hence, if this &quot;fault&quot; statement surmounts to hearsay obstacle, the opinion rule should not, in my view, stand in the way. </P></FEEDBACK> <MAPPER ID="142" BOUNDS="8284,5755,109">  <BRANCH KIND="15" NAME="A" DEST="142" BOUNDS="8272,5803,16"/>  <BRANCH KIND="15" NAME="B" DEST="142" BOUNDS="8298,5803,16"/>  <BRANCH KIND="14" NAME="C" DEST="144" BOUNDS="8324,5803,16"/>  <BRANCH KIND="14" NAME="D" DEST="144" BOUNDS="8350,5803,16"/>  <BRANCH KIND="11" NAME="Next" DEST="144" BOUNDS="8376,5803,30"/> </MAPPER></PAGE>

R. Civ. P. 32 would be severely undermined if it were read so that objections were waived whenever, under any conceivable set of facts, the objection might possibly have been obviated. If this approach were taken, hardly any hearsay objection would be waived, since there would always be a conceivable, if remote, chance that a foundation could have been laid for admission under one of the many exceptions. The standard ought to be whether it was probable that the objection could be obviated, not whether it was remotely conceivable that it could have been obviated.</P><P>In the instant case, it seems most unlikely that the objection could have in fact been obviated by laying a foundation for an excited utterance. The statement was made half an hour after the accident; the deponent did not volunteer any comments about the excitement; the person making the statement had no apparent connection with the accident. Probably the teenager was not excited. Therefore, I would hold that the objection has not been waived, at least in the absence of some specific showing that the defense counsel could have laid the foundation for an excited utterance.

You correctly answered that it should be sustained. By failing to object to the testimony at the deposition, Plaintiff's counsel waived the objection. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(d)(3)(A).</P><P>You were then asked to consider the objection assuming that an objection HAD been made at the deposition and that defense counsel had failed to cure the defect complained of. You correctly answered that, in this circumstance, the objection should still be sustained.</P><P>Defense counsel's question concerning the signaling by the police officer was objectionably leading. Although Plaintiff's counsel initiated the deposition and the question was asked on cross-examination, it would be inappropriate to permit leading questions in this circumstance. The purpose of the leading question rule is to prevent a lawyer from putting words into the mouth of a cooperative witness. Here, the witness appeared to be favorable to Defendant and hence the purpose of the leading question rule would be served by requiring that the questions be asked in a non-leading form. Fed. R. Evid. 611(c) does not say that leading is invariably permitted on cross-examination. In this sort of situation, the mere fact that the other party initiated the discovery deposition should not open the door for the use of leading questions by Defendant's counsel. See <I>Oberlin v. Marlin American Corp</I>., 596 F.2d 1322 (7th Cir. 1979).</P><P>A substantial argument can be made that the leading was permissible because it was necessary to develop the witness' testimony as permitted by Fed. R. Evid. 611(c). When asked what he said to the Plaintiff, the witness did not at first mention anything about the police officer, so it was arguably necessary to mention the police officer to get the witness to testify about the matter. On the other hand, the attorney could attempt to get at the matter in a less leading manner by asking, &quot;Did you say anything else?&quot; or even &quot;Did you say anything concerning the police officer?&quot;. However, it is within the judge's discretion whether or not this was necessary. You were thus correct to sustain the objection to the question. </P><P>Let's return to the main menu.</P></TEXT> <NOTES><P>6/21/2006 DQ addd tagline as transition. </P></NOTES> <MAPPER ID="228" BOUNDS="11226,7830,109">  <BRANCH KIND="11" NAME="Next" DEST="1" BOUNDS="11266,7878,30"/> </MAPPER></PAGE>
